# BurntNet

This repository contains an unofficial implementation of the BurntNet from the paper "Burnt-Net: Wildfire burned area mapping with single post-fire Sentinel-2 data and deep learning morphological neural network".

The implementation is based on PyTorch. Erosion and Dilation operators are implemented through Kornia's library.
